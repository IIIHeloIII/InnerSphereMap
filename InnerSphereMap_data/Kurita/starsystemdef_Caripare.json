    "Details": "[3052] Clan Nova Cat issued a batchall for Caripare in February 3052, and was told that the world was defended by one green regiment. Caripare's position in the Smoke Jaguar - Nova Cat corridor, near the front lines but far enough away to eliminate it as an easy target for raiders, made Clan Nova Cat eager to conquer this productive agricultural world was as little damage as possible.Hoping for any easy victory against an inexperienced unit, but well aware that the Combine commander might have lied about his troops strength of configuration, Star Colonel Gritas bid to take the planet with two Trinaries of the First Nova Cat Guards. The Clan forces landed near Johnson Lake and immediately came under attack by elements of the elite Second Ghost Regiment hidden in the water's depths.This deception set the tone for the hard-fought battle that followed. Star Colonel Gritas eventually called down another Trinary, justifying the fact that she broke her bid by pointing to the Kurita commander's misinformation and reiterating the Khans' desire to use the planet for supply purposes. The additional troops allowed her to take the world, but could not help her avoid a fierce running battle that destroyed the centuries old Trevorton Forest.Recognizing Caripare's strategic importance, Clan Smoke Jaguar immediately challenged Clan Nova Cat to a Trial of Possession for the planet. Unwilling to destroy any more of Caripare's resources, the Khans of both Clans agreed, after a long and acrimonious debate, to share the conquest of the world and administer it jointly."
