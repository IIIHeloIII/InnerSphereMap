    "Details": "[3025] Buckminster has undergone rapid changes in the last 20 years.  Once known for its agricultural products and light industrial items such as tractors or threshers, Buckminster used to have close ties with the nearby Steiner world of Port Moseby, an eager customer of its products.  It was a peaceful world, whose inhabitants considered themselves fortunate.That all changed when the prefecture capital moved from Sulafat to Buckminster.  Now that Buckminster is both a prefecture and a frontline world on the Steiner border, the DCMS considers it doubly necessary to protect the planet.  The elite 2nd Sword of Light is now stationed here.  With so many Kurita BattleMechs present and training for war, the abundant crops of Buckminster are being crushed under the tread of heavy metal feet.  This has angered the people of Buckminster.  In the past 20 years, many over and covert anti-government groups have formed, giving the numerous ISF agents on the planet plenty to do.The capital of Buckminster, Buckminster City, is located on the continent of Sanjusendo."
