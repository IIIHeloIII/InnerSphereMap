    "You know the rule of war, don't you? 'Money can buy anything except honor.' While you have none of the latter, we have plenty of the former. Fight like the dog of war you are, and we may overlook your past transgressions.",
    "You know what I love best about mercenaries? You're willing to wade into battle when it's too dangerous for us to risk our own soldiers. So take the job, MechWarrior—fight and die for money, as is your role.",
    "Beggars can't be choosers, and neither can the frugal. This contract is a budget affair best suited to scoundrels such as yourself. No matter what your failings, you are willing to fight for money, yes? We can provide money.",
    "Hail, Commander. House Steiner has an operation we think you'll find interesting as well as lucrative. I'll be certain to recommend you to my superiors if you perform well.",

  "MissionSuccessStatement": "Large coffers pay for larger victories—and you have been instrumental in ensuring that our winning streak is intact. Excellent work, mercenary. House Steiner is pleased.",
  "GoodFaithFailureStatement": "The Lyran Commonwealth didn't get where it is by accepting victory or defeat as inevitable, but by continuing to fight after a loss. I hope you'll do the same, Commander. While you were defeated, you acquitted yourself well.",
  "BadFaithFailureStatement": "House Steiner has no place for cowards or failures, Commander. Ensure your future efforts are more robust, or the Lyran Commonwealth will be no friend to you.",
