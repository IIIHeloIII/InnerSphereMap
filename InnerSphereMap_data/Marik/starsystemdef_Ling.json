    "Details": "[2987] In 2987, a Steiner task force moved deep within the Free Worlds League's borders, and made a landing on Ling. Unprepared by the surprise assault (a fact that embattled Captain-General Stephan Marik's staff claimed was a direct result of Parliament's cutbacks to the SAFE budget), the planetary air defenses fell quickly to the well organized attackers.At the same time, two 'Mech regiments dropped on the planet's surface and drove through the defending garrison, reaching and crippling the secret light 'Mech production facility that was under construction there. Although the task force suffered major losses during subsequent raids on Nathan, Ryerson, Irian, Park Place and Bordon, the destruction of the much-prized new factory could not be erased.Spokesmen on both sides of the Parliament hurled bitter recriminations at each other. To take any kind of significant action against the Lyrans, however, Stephan Marik needed the cooperation of the dissident Houses, and the only way to obtain this was to swallow his pride and accept additional conditions on the Captain-General's power. Parliament demanded and received the right to participate in the division of spoils from captured territories (officially recorded in the Replevin Doctrine document) and a greater voice in the approval of military dispositions (Special Resolution 523).
