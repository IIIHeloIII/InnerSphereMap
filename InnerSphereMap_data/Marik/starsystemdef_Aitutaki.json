    "Details": "[3059] The most independent-minded of the League's military schools, the Aitutaki Academy has provided the Principality of Regulus with officers and troops for the past 650 years. Founded by order of Hered Selaj in 2414, the academy has been inextricably entwined with the fortunes of the principality ever since. Despite the best efforts of the LCCC, this academy remains a bastion of anti-Marik sentiment. Rumors suggest that a large number of each year's new cadets are actually SAFE operatives assigned to keep an eye on instructors and pupils.Since Thomas Marik assumed the Captain-Generalcy, the Quartermaster General has managed to consistently thwart the academy's attempts to maintain a Regulan-only admissions policy. In the past three years the academy has apparently accepted the LCCC's admissions guidelines, choosing to control who graduates by other measures.Aitutaki imposes a strict physical-fitness regime on its students, with callisthenics and various sports a part of daily life. Field craft - particularly navigation, hunting and survival - is an important element of the standard first year of training.The academy covers all aspects of ground warfare, but specializes in training MechWarriors and armor crews. For much of the Succession Wars the academy maintained an aerospace training program, but this branch of the school was disbanded following a series of fatal training accidents in 2996. Aitutaki also maintains a strong technical tradition, particularly in field maintenance techniques, and it consistently produces some of the best technicians in the League. The LCCC has attempted to force the academy's technical training staff to relocate to remove this vital part of the military education system from Regulan control, but has thus far met with little success.Aitutaki maintains the ancient military tradition of hazing - inflicting pseudo-torture on new entrants - and has used sanctioned abuse to persuade \"undesirables\" to leave the academy within the first semester. The Captain-General and the LCCC have ordered the school's administration to end this practice and punish those who implement hazing, but the Academy's commandant has denied responsibility for any such incidents.Sixty MechWarriors a year graduate from the Aitutaki Academy, along with almost ten-times that number in other military specialities. The LCCC deliberately assigns most of these graduates away from the Regulan Hussars regiments, but this practice does little to moderate academy graduate's pro-Regulus, anti-Marik views."
